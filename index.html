					<h2>About Me</h2>
						<p>A UX designer by trade, a scientist in a previous life and a 'developer' very occassionally and with strong supervision, I consider these projects my playground in the world of web development. Before "Project 1", my coding experience consisted solely of questionable design choices on a Bebo profile in 2007 and a school project around the same time. And Neopets. Talk about a steep learning curve.</p>
